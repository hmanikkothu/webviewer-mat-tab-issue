WebViewer comes with a 7-day trial without any feature limitations or trial key needed. To extend the trial, you can obtain the trial key by [signing-up](https://dev.apryse.com/) on our [developer portal](https://dev.apryse.com/).

## Initial setup

cd webviewer-angular-sample
npm install

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run build-prod` to build the production build of the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
